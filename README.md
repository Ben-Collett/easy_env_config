## about
Easy Env Config is a Python-based tool designed to simplify the management of environment variables and shell aliases. The tool takes a JSON configuration as input and generates shell-specific scripts to set the corresponding environment variables and aliases. It aims to support multiple shell environments, including:

    Bash

    Zsh

    Fish

    NuShell

    PowerShell

The project is written entirely in a single Python file, which includes both the core functionality and unit tests. Keeping all the code in one file is intended as a challenge for the developer and it is highly advised to never do anything like this.

on the plus side it means that running the program is just running one script.
